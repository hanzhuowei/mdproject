-Experience:
The decision to switch my main area from high-frequency technology to signal processing was made in the first semester in my master study. By taking part in courses and labs in this field at university as well as using online materials, e.g. MOOC, Github etc.,  i have gained the profound core skills, which enables me to handle both application-related (e.g. research project in Robert Bosch) and research-related (master thesis about speech processing) problems. 

Machine learning and patter recognition is also a research area of signal processing that motivated me to do my master thesis about speech emotion recognition with deep learning techniques. From this project i have gained the experience in the following field: spectral feature extraction with audio signal processing, unsupervised feature learning with probabilistic model
