##Inhalt 
- Audio-DSV,  FFT-Spectral-MFCCs
- Traditional Approaches of Emotion Recognition
	Supervised feature learning + classification
- State of the Art deep learning techniques
	- GMM-HMM
	- GMM-SVM
- Unsupervised feature learning 
	- Probabilistic graphical model: CRBM
- Outperform supervised feature learning
	- richer representation
	- learning hidden structure of low level feature
	- Building complex high-level features using unlabeled data
- LSTM
 	- good at sequence modelling
	- capturing long & short variations
	- model arbitary dynamic system
- Training the deep model need tricks and requires large dataset
- Implementation with Python2
