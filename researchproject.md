# Research Project

The research project about ultrasonic sensor signal processing in the driver assistent system was significant to me. It was the first time i participated in a industrial project, which is considered to be advanced research in automotive field and highly related to the future product.  Besides the function development experience and gained technical skills, i had an overview of the project management as a member of the whole project.  

Role and Tasks:
- Design and perform measurement in lab and test ground
- Analyse measurement data and optimize parameter & algorithm
- Present results and report problems in weekly meeting
- Tool development for automatic analyse
- Further implementation of desired function and code documentation
